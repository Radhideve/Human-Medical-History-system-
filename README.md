# Aayur rekha - the human medical history system
The HMH system is a simple system to directly

save your life and your family life's in a Single

touch.

The medical history is not a simple data

it's all about your life.this information gives your

doctor all kinds of important clues about what’s

going on with your health, because many

diseases run in families. The history also tells

your doctor what health issues you may be at risk

for in the future. If your doctor learns, for

example, that both of your parents have heart

disease, they may focus on your heart health

when you’re much younger than other patients

who don’t have a family history of heart disease.
